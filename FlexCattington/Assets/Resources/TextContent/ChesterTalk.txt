As your charge and Chester settle down for drinks, Chester introduces himself with flawless ease. Your charge fumbles a bit with their introduction, but are successful enough and don't mess up big time. However, Chester seems to have such an elegant aura about him that it's clearly off-putting to your charge. This is your time to make sure things don't go horribly; how should your charge get this date rolling?

!o Dive into a deep conversation about the meaning of life !s 10 !i 2
!oTalk about each other's favorite books!s 0 !i 1
!oTalk about the weather!s -10 !i 3

!nChester seems neither upset nor pleased about the topic, but he indulges nonetheless. The two chat idly about their favorite books and what sort of things they like to read. Your charge still appears to be on edge, and Chester doesn't look so relaxed either. Eventually, the topic changes over to cats, and your charge appears to be trying to remember the name of Chester's cats. It's clear they've forgotten. Oh dear, now would be the time to intervene. What are the cats' names?

!nChester immediately throws himself into the conversation, apparently glad to have avoided small talk. While your charge seems nonplussed at how ardent Chester is, they certainly seem much calmer than they were initially. Somehow the topic shifts to cats, and your charge goes to make a comment on Chester's cats, but they're hesitant. Oh no, did they forget the names? Now's the time for you to step in! What are the cats' names?

!oElizabeth and Anna!s 0 !i 4
!oVronsky and Anna  !s 10 !i 5
!oSnowball and Tuna!s -10 !i 6


!nChester pulls the most sour expression you've ever seen. Uh oh. It's clear now that he's one of those people that hate small talk with an absolute burning passion. The air between the two is uncomfortable to say the least. The conversation abruptly changes to cats, and your charge appears to be fishing for the names of Chester's cats, which Chester had mentioned earlier. Oh boy, with the way things are going they really can't afford to mess up this. Time to help out! What are the cats' names?

!oElizabeth and Anna!s 0 !i 4
!oVronsky and Anna  !s 10 !i 5
!oSnowball and Tuna!s -10 !i 6

!nChester chuckles half-heartedly and says not quite. He goes on to talk about the cats, and your charge listens intently. Chester still seems a tad bored with the date, but he's not outright upset, so you're doing a fair enough of a job.

!nChester's lips quirk up in a smile. He asks your charge if they know what book the names allude to, and to his surprise they do. The two talk about the book for several minutes, and the air around the two is relaxed. Nice going!

!nChester frowns...well that, that is not a good sign. Looks like you really messed up. It takes a bit to get the conversation going, and even then Chester doesn't seem invested enough to say much. You bite your nails, wondering if this will end up working out...
